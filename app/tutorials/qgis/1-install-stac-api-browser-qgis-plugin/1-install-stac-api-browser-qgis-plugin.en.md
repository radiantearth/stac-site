# Install the QGIS STAC API Browser Plugin

In this introduction tutorial, you will learn how to install the STAC plugin into [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). This and the following tutorial are adapted from the [QGIS STAC API Browser site](https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin/).

To install the plugin, you will launch the QGIS application and open the Plugin Manager. You can access the Plugin Manager by nagivating from the QGIS Toolbar > **Plugins** tab > **Manage and Install Plugins**.

If you are simply looking for the standard plugin download, you can stop this tutorial here. If you are needing to download a past or future version of the plugin for a specific use case, continue on to see the pre-release download methods.

## Alternative Download Methods

The following two download methods are for obtaining pre-release or deprecated versions of the STAC API Browser.

These installation methods could be preferred if there is a pre-released version of the STAC QGIS plugin that you would like to use that is not yet available in the official QGIS Plugin Repository.

It is important to note that _QGIS does not recommend installing deprecated plugins unless there are no alternatives available_.

### Install from a ZIP file

1. Visit [https://github.com/stac-utils/qgis-stac-plugin/releases](https://github.com/stac-utils/qgis-stac-plugin/releases) and select the desired version of the plugin.

2. Download your selected release ZIP file.

3. From the **Install from ZIP** page in the QGIS plugin manager, add the downloaded ZIP file.

4. Click the **Install Plugin** button.

### Install from the Creation of a Custom Plugin Repository

The **STAC API Browser** plugin is also available through a custom plugin repository. This method is comparable to the ZIP file installation method, but can only be used for downloading pre-release versions of the plugin (and not deprecated plugin versions).

1. Navigate to the **Settings** section of the Plugin Manager.

2. Check the **Show also experimental plugins** box.
    - The plugin versions available through the custom repository may be flagged experimental because they might contain plugin versions that have not yet been approved by QGIS for official use.

3. Click the **Add** button in the **Plugin Repositories** box.

4. Select a name for the plugin (e.g. "Custom STAC Plugin Repository").

5. In the URL section, use [https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin/repository/plugins.xml](https://stac-utils.github.io/qgis-stac-plugin/repository/plugins.xml) to create a new plugin repository.
